            In a dystopian future where capital controls both life and technology, humans and machines have begun to merge through brutal experimentation under a secret program known as KL-13. Designed to implant AI into human brains and convert living bodies into obedient cybernetic weapons, the project ultimately collapsed—some subjects became empty husks while the Machines themselves awakened into unstable self-aware beings. You play as one of KL-13’s “failures,” a test subject who miraculously retains a sense of self despite multiple neural implants and severe memory loss. Awakening in a long-abandoned research hospital that once served as the core of these modifications, you must navigate sealed laboratories, corrupted terminals, and hostile cyborg units while piecing together fragmented memories and uncovering the truth of your creation. With scarce resources, relentless enemies, and a world ruled by a new machine-human orthodoxy, your journey becomes a struggle for survival, identity, and vengeance in a future where even consciousness can be rewritten like code.

            This game is initially inspired by the <em>Resident Evil Series</em> and <em>Atomic Heart</em>. In terms of mechanics, our group wishes to incorporate  safe rooms, shooting/aiming/conventions as well as the level design from the <em>Resident Evil Series</em> that raises the playability as well as the tension of <em>Code: Escape</em>. For the visual direction, we are looking toward <em>Atomic Heart</em>’s retro biopunk horror aesthetic, blending its surreal, body-mechanical distortions with our own worldbuilding to create a distinctive and unsettling environment.

            The level is designed as a compact, linear survival-horror environment that guides the player and reveals the narrative. The player begins in a safe room on the second floor. From this point, progression requires solving environmental puzzles that unlock doors , restore limited power, and reveal new corridors of the abandoned hospital. Each puzzle is tied to fragments of story information, encouraging players to explore carefully and piece together their lost memories.

          <p>
            In my future projects I want to improve on several points: <br>
            1.	The current controls are sometimes off, which might interrupts the game experience. <br> 
            2.	Due to limited time, our group did not have time for playtests and iteration process. In future projects we wish to alloate more time for gaining user feedbacks. <br>

              Code Escape is a survival-horror FPS set in a robot-controlled futuristic hospital where machinery has gained autonomy and human bodies are reshaped through corporate experimentation. The game emphasizes scarce ammo, limited healing, and high-stakes encounters turn every decision into a matter of life or death. Players awaken with fragmented memories and must navigate corrupted labs, locked wards, and hostile cyborg units while solving environmental puzzles and uncovering disturbing truths about the facility.

            <p>
              This project is led by a three-people group. As the concept artist and environment designer, I shaped the visual identity and atmosphere of Code Escape. I developed concept art for environments, enemies, and key set pieces, establishing the tone of a machine-dominated hospital. I designed environmental layouts, lighting direction, and visual cues that support navigation and narrative tension, using props and spatial storytelling to reveal the world’s history.
