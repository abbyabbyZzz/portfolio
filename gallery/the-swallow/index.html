          <p class="process-body">
            Ann, a quiet and enigmatic student, disappeared without explanation. Mia, driven by ambition and a passion for storytelling, views this disappearance as the perfect topic for her next film. One night, she sneaks into the school to uncover the truth—only to find herself trapped within Ann’s memory palace. 
          </p>
          <p class="process-body">
            Inside this world, Mia’s camera unexpectedly activates, serving as a bridge between reality and Ann’s mind. When used, it reveals hidden layers and secrets embedded in the environment. The camera becomes both a tool for navigation and a metaphor for perception.

            The project is strongly inspired by <em>Visage</em> and <em>Devotion</em>. <em>Visage</em> is a first-person point of view psychological horror game developed by SadSquare Studio. Visage demonstrates a secondary world design, where new layers of information, the supernatural or the horror part, is built within a realistic world. The game is very successful in creating immersivity for the user by incorporating realistic sound effects that brings out the horror atmosphere and creating a finalized environment for the user to explore. The visuals and the objectives of the worldbuilding assignment were largely inspired by Visage where the user will find out a linear story through a nonlinear experience in exploring the environment. I want to incorporate the similar atmosphere of <em>Visage</em> for my world building assignment.

            I want to include Chinese folklore elements within my environment by adding elements of rituals and superstitions like protective charms and traditional folk remedies-- using herbal, animal parts, or bloodletting actions to cure diseases—in the environment. I used the Chinese horror game <em>Devotion (还愿)</em> as a visual reference of my project. The protagonist in the game could not accept that his daughter had mental illness. Therefore, he turns to a “master” and tries various folk remedies to “cure” her. As a result, her condition worsens, leading to her tragic death at home. <em>Devotion</em> criticizes the people who blindly believes in superstitions. In this project, it is the people’s ignorance and superstition that lead Ann’s disappearance. The incorporation of these Chinese folklore elements will not only add depth to the environment but also enhance the overall atmosphere of the narrative. By drawing inspiration from traditional practices and beliefs, I want to create a sense of authenticity and cultural richness in Ann’s story.

            The immersive environment was designed to reflect Ann’s fragmented mental state. I made the lighting of the school dark to convey a depress emotional atmosphere. Elements like flickering lights, ghostly sounds, and impossible architecture heighten the atmosphere of anxiety and isolation. The design balances psychological horror with emotional storytelling—encouraging players to explore, interpret, and survive within a deeply personal world.

          <p class="process-body">
          	This project is the first time I learn about the concept of game and space. From this project, I gained knowledge on ways of environmental storytelling, specifically, how space, lighting, sound, and other objects can be used to communicate emotion and narrative. Technically, I also learned how to use Unity to construct interactive environments, implement lighting setups, and create scripted events that support horror pacing. In Maya, I became more comfortable with modeling, UV mapping, and preparing assets for game integration, allowing me to build props and environmental elements that carried narrative meaning. 
          </p>

          <p class="process-body">
            In my future projects I want to improve on several points: <br>
            1.	Strengthen my Unity workflow by learning advanced features to enhance atmosphere and visual consistency.<br> 
            2.	Explore more dynamic interaction systems so the environment can respond to player actions—shifting layouts, evolving lighting, or memory-triggered events—to enhance immersion.<br>

              An immersive environment where the setting is at a high school in 1980s China that represents the main character’s inner world. The structures inside the school are constructed according to her impression of the world. The school emphasizes and tilts her fear. Therefore, supernatural things will happen in the school. The player can use a camera that is accidentally activated as a connection of the reality and the world. It can reflect things hidden within this world. The user can use the camera as a hint in discovering the world.
